## Simple Wordle Solver Bot

A simple bot capable of solving Wordles.

### How to Use

1. Run the bot.

2. Enter the bot’s guess into Wordle.

3. Input the color results into the terminal using:

   * `0` for **grey**
   * `1` for **yellow**
   * `2` for **green**
     Separate the numbers with commas.

   **Example:**
   If Wordle returns *Grey, Yellow, Yellow, Grey, Green*, enter:
   `0,1,1,0,2`

4. Repeat until the bot solves it… or runs out of tries.

**Good luck!**
(P.S.) This is just a little bot I built in my spare time. Honestly, I advise you all to actually try solving the Wordle yourself rather than relying on a bot. It's a really fun daily puzzle :)
